 Version 1.0.10 (revision 79)
-----------------------------
 - fixed excessive spacing around keywords and highlighted text in the code preview window on Windows 7

 Version 1.0.9 (revision 77)
-----------------------------
 - the minimum scrollbar width is forced to 8
 - added a command which toggles the visibility of the MetalScroll bar (MetalScroll.Connect.Toggle) 
 - the add-in refuses to load if Rockscroll is present
 - the installer disables Rockscroll if it's found
 - fixed: if the add-in was loaded manually after VS was started, the windows which were already open didn't get a MetalScroll bar 

 Version 1.0.8 (revision 70)
-----------------------------
 - whitespace is no longer highlighted on alt-double click
 - added some code which should make it cooperate with ReSharper, if ReSharper would cooperate too

 Version 1.0.7 (revision 68)
-----------------------------
 - added support for word wrapping
 - middle click preview improvements:
     - tabs are correctly expanded inside strings and comments
     - multi-line comments are recognized
     - it works with word wrapping and hidden text regions
 - the current page marker has a minimum height of 15 pixels
 - fixed: in the middle click preview, an escaped backslash right before the terminating quote of a string was parsed as an escaped quote, leading to incorrect highlighting in the following code
 - fixed: // and /* inside strings caused the following text to be incorrectly painted as a comment on the bar
 - fixed: placing a breakpoint on the last line in a file could lead to a crash
 - fixed: horizontal dark lines sometimes appeared on the bar when the code image had to be scaled to fit
 - fixed: the add-in didn't work if the horizontal scrollbar of the text editor was turned off in the VS options

 Version 1.0.6 (revision 52)
-----------------------------
 - the scrollbar only colors C-style comments in C-like language files (i.e. C, C++ and C#)
 - the middle click preview only applies syntax highlighting for C-like language files
 - words highlighted by (alt-)double-click are also marked in the middle-click preview window
 - fixed: some words were mistakenly highlighted as C++ keywords in the middle click preview 
 
 Version 1.0.5 (revision 50)
-----------------------------
 - holding down ALT for double-click highlighting is optional
 - when the code image is taller than the scrollbar, it is scaled with a linear filter
 - replaced the middle-click preview tooltip with a custom window which uses a fixed width font and features basic syntax highlighting and proper tab handling
 - fixed: right edge markers (breakpoints, bookmarks etc.) were drawn at a hardcoded location instead of respecting the real bar width
 - fixed: double-click highlighting was also marking partial matches; it only matches whole words now
 - fixed: tabs were always expanded as tab-size pixels, instead of jumping to the next tab-size-aligned column

 Version 1.0.4 (revision 41)
-----------------------------
 - fixed: alt-double click on a blank line freezes the IDE
