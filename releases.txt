 Version 1.0.6 (revision 52)
-----------------------------
  - the scrollbar only colors C-style comments in C-like language files (i.e. C, C++ and C#)
  - the middle click preview only applies syntax highlighting for C-like language files
  - words highlighted by (alt-)double-click are also marked in the middle-click preview window
  - fixed: some words were mistakenly highlighted as C++ keywords in the middle click preview 
 
 Version 1.0.5 (revision 50)
-----------------------------
  - holding down ALT for double-click highlighting is optional
  - when the code image is taller than the scrollbar, it is scaled with a linear filter
  - replaced the middle-click preview tooltip with a custom window which uses a fixed width font and features basic syntax highlighting and proper tab handling
  - fixed: right edge markers (breakpoints, bookmarks etc.) were drawn at a hardcoded location instead of respecting the real bar width
  - fixed: double-click highlighting was also marking partial matches; it only matches whole words now
  - fixed: tabs were always expanded as tab-size pixels, instead of jumping to the next tab-size-aligned column

 Version 1.0.4 (revision 41)
-----------------------------
